# Overview


This app, Date-Picker (until I think of a better name), is an app that is designed to pull in numerous date/activtiy ideas from the web and organize them into a database. Then, when a user enters their criteria for their perfect date the app will algorithmically select activities and organize a date that matches all of their preferences. It will make scheduling well-planned dates and activities simple and provide a way to quickly organize them in little to no time at all. Eventually this app will also provide a space for communities of people to share and vote on their favorite activities.

I started developing this app because my wife would ask me each week what we should do for date night and I was stressed out trying to juggle plans and present new ideas all the time. I created this app in order to solve my problem. My vision is: She asks what date we should go on and within a minute I'll have a fully scheduled date that meets all of our criteria. (budget, timeframe, stay in/go out, etc..)

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and Expo Go.

I developed this app using React Native. React Native is a cross-platform language that closely resembles the React web language.

Notable Libraries:
nativewind (tailwind css for react native apps)
expo-Location
react-native-community/datetimepicker

# Future Work

* UI: I'm not using space effectively and it's not very visually appealing.
* Generation Algorithm: I've developed most of the UI, now I need to sort out the logic behind it.
* Database: I need to build a large, clean dataset to make the app work well.
