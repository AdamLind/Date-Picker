# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}
This app, Date-Picker (until I think of a better name), is an app that is designed to pull in numerous date/activtiy ideas from the web and organize them into a database. Then, when a user enters their criteria for their perfect date the app will algorithmically select and organize a date that matches all of their preferences. It will make scheduling activities and dates much simpler and provide a way to quickly organize a well-planned date or activity in little to no time at all. Eventually this app will also provide a space for communities of people to share and vote on their favorite activities.

{Describe your purpose for creating this app.}
I started developing this app because my wife would constantly ask me what we should do for date night and I was stressed out trying to juggle plans and present new ideas all the time. I created this app in order to solve my problem. She asks what date we should go on and within a minute I'll have a fully scheduled date that meets all of our criteria. (budget, timeframe, stay in/go out, etc..)

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the app}
I used VS Code and Expo Go.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I developed this app using React Native. React Native is a cross-platform language that closely resembles the React web language.
Notable Libraries:
nativewind (tailwind css for react native apps)
expo-Location
react-native-community/datetimepicker

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* UI: Currently I'm not using space effectively and it's not very visually appealing.
* Generation Algorithm: I've developed most of the UI, now I need to sort out the logic behind it.
* Database: I need to build a large, clean dataset to make the app work well.
